It is not permitted to place a marker in any of the (up to) eight cells around the cell that a marker was last placed in by the opposing player. A player can win by connecting any pair of two corners of the board with a chain of their pieces, by connecting any three of the boards four sides (excluding corners), or by being the last player to make a legal move. Diagonal connections between markers also count for the purpose of establishing connections.")
